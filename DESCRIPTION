Description: Implements a multi-path forward selection algorithm using the Akaike 
    Information Criterion (AIC) for both linear (Gaussian) and logistic (binomial) 
    regression models. Unlike traditional stepwise methods that follow a single path, 
    this approach explores multiple competitive model paths simultaneously by retaining 
    near-optimal models at each step. The package includes stability estimation via 
    bootstrap resampling and identifies plausible models based on AIC tolerance and 
    variable stability thresholds.
